# AsciiArtify Kubernetes Cluster Deployment Tools Analysis

## Introduction
AsciiArtify plans to deploy their Kubernetes clusters locally for development and testing purposes. We evaluated three popular tools for local Kubernetes cluster deployment: minikube, kind (Kubernetes IN Docker), and k3d. This document provides an analysis of each tool to assist in choosing the most suitable one for AsciiArtify's Proof of Concept (PoC).

## Features Comparison
| Feature            | Minikube                         | kind                             | k3d                              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Supported OS       | Linux, macOS, Windows            | Linux, macOS, Windows            | Linux, macOS, Windows            |
| Architecture       | x86_64, arm64                    | x86_64                           | x86_64, arm64                    |
| Automation         | Limited                          | Yes                              | Yes                              |
| Additional Features| Limited                          | Monitoring, Management           | Monitoring, Management           |

## Advantages and Disadvantages
### Minikube
- Advantages:
  - Easy to use
  - Widely adopted
- Disadvantages:
  - Limited scalability
  - Slower deployment compared to other tools

### kind
- Advantages:
  - Easy to deploy Kubernetes clusters in Docker containers
  - Fast deployment
- Disadvantages:
  - May have compatibility issues with certain Kubernetes features

### k3d
- Advantages:
  - Rapid creation and testing of Kubernetes clusters
  - Good documentation and community support
- Disadvantages:
  - May require more resources compared to other tools

## Demonstration
We recommend using k3d for AsciiArtify's PoC. Below is a brief demonstration of deploying a "Hello World" application on Kubernetes using k3d:
- Step 1:
  - k3d cluster create my-cluster
  - kubectl cluster-info
- Step 2:
  - docker build -t my-flask-app .
- Step 3:
  - kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
  - kubectl get deployments
- Step 4:
  - kubectl apply -f service.yaml
  - kubectl get services
  - kubectl get nodes -o wide
